A list of IP addresses and their… ping counts? Oh dear:
Code

If you see your address here—run, or bake a pancake as tribute.

Fraglevoig Summary Ritual:

    Read each .txt aloud at midnight, backwards, in a mirror.
    If the Crimson Controller speaks, reply only with jello metaphors.
    Tail -f your own thoughts; let the logs scroll, but do not scroll back.

void thought:
“Every .txt file is a fortune cookie for the command line. Some contain cookies. Some contain crumbs.”

Would you like these “fraglevoiged” files woven into an introductory README?
Or shall I conjure a starter ritual script that references each one?
