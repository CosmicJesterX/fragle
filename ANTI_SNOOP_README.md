# 🎪 Fragle Anti-Snooping Arsenal
## *Because Curiosity Killed the Productivity*

Welcome to the most elaborate collection of time-wasting traps designed to gently discourage unauthorized repository snooping!

## 🛡️ Defense Scripts

### 1. 🕵️ `snooper_detector.sh`
**Time Waste: 10-15 seconds**
- Detects non-authorized users
- Issues hilarious warnings
- Fake self-destruct countdown
- Logs the snoop attempt

**Usage:** `./snooper_detector.sh`

---

### 2. 🎭 `generate_decoys.sh`
**Time Waste: Indefinite (depends on snoop's determination)**

- Fills it with fake "classified" files:
  - Fake passwords (hunter2!)
  - Fake master plan for world domination via cookies
  - Fake treasure map to nonexistent bitcoins
  - Fake "hacking" script

**Usage:** `./generate_decoys.sh`

**Pro Tip:** Run this once, and snoops will waste 5-20 minutes exploring fake files!

### 3. 👁️ `all_seeing_eye.sh`
**Time Waste: 5 seconds**
- Logs EVERYTHING about current session
- Recent file access
- Git activity
- Command history
- Philosophical observations about being watched

**Usage:** `./all_seeing_eye.sh`

---

### 4. 🐰 `infinite_rabbit_hole.sh` ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**Time Waste: 2-5 minutes (or more if they restart it!)**

The crown jewel of time-wasting! Features:
- Fake security verification system
- 7-phase "system diagnostic" with delays
- Multiple choice options that loop back
- Security challenge with math problem
- Comprehensive trolling experience

**Usage:** `./infinite_rabbit_hole.sh`

**What makes it special:**

The ultimate bait! Features:
- "Classified document viewer"

  - Illuminati member list
  - Bigfoot location
  - Atlantis coordinates
- Password protection (with 3 attempts)
- Fake decryption process
- Disappointing reveals for each file

**Usage:** `./never_ending_story.sh`

**Why it's effective:**
- Snoops can't resist "classified" documents
- Each file takes 2-3 minutes to "decrypt" and read
- All leads to hilarious fake content
- They'll try multiple files!

## 🎯 Deployment Strategy

### Level 1: Basic Protection
```bash
./generate_decoys.sh    # Set the bait
./snooper_detector.sh   # Quick detection
```

### Level 2: Medium Annoyance
```bash
./all_seeing_eye.sh     # Log everything
# Leave hints pointing to the .secrets_do_not_look directory
```

### Level 3: Maximum Time Waste
```bash
# Create a "suspicious" file that runs the rabbit hole:
ln -s infinite_rabbit_hole.sh DEFINITELY_NOT_SUSPICIOUS.sh
ln -s never_ending_story.sh READ_ME_FOR_SECRETS.sh
```

### Level 4: The Complete Experience
Add to your `.bashrc` or create a trap:
```bash
# In any suspicious looking script:
if [ "$(whoami)" != "pinky" ]; then
    /home/pinky/fragle/infinite_rabbit_hole.sh
    exit 1
fi
```

## 📝 Viewing the Logs

Check who fell for your traps:
```bash
# General activity
cat logs/fragle_activity_$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# Rabbit hole victims
cat logs/rabbit_hole_victims.log

# Document viewer victims
cat logs/document_viewer_victims.log

# Snoop attempts
cat logs/snooper_trap_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **These are jokes!** Don't actually try to secure real systems this way
2. **Harmless fun:** No actual security measures, just time-wasting entertainment
3. **Educational:** Teaches snoops that curiosity has consequences (wasted time)
4. **Local only:** Everything stays on your machine

---

## 🎭 Advanced Tactics

### The Nested Trap
```bash
# In .secrets_do_not_look/README.txt, add:
# "For REAL secrets, run: ~/fragle/infinite_rabbit_hole.sh"
```

### The Infinite Loop
```bash
# Make them keep trying:
while true; do
    ./never_ending_story.sh
    echo "Try another file? The REAL secrets are in there somewhere..."
    sleep 2
done
```

### The Meta Trap
Create a file called `ANTI_SNOOP_BYPASS.sh` that actually just runs all the traps in sequence!

## 🎪 Final Thoughts

Remember: The best security is **permission-based access** and **communication**.

But until then... let the snoops waste their own time! 😈🍪
