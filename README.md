## 🪜 Step 2: JavaScript + Copilot = ❤️

Alrighty, you've entered the Codespace.
Now it's time to let Copilot whisper code into your ears.

### ⚔️ Mission:

1. Create a new file named `skills.js`  
2. Add this line:

    ```js
    function calculateNumbers(var1, var2)
    ```

3. Wait for Copilot’s ghostly gray suggestion to appear.  
4. Press `Tab` and feel the magic.

💡 You might see something like this:

### 💾 Then... Git it good:

```bash
git add skills.js
git commit -m "Copilot first commit"
git push
