## 🎯 What Is This?

**Fragle** is a collection of hilariously elaborate bash scripts designed to:
- 🛡️ Detect unauthorized repository snooping
- 😂 Troll persistent snoopers with increasingly ridiculous responses
- 🍪 Welcome authorized friends warmly
- 📝 Log everything for your entertainment
- ⏳ Waste maximum time for the greedy and curious

**Perfect for:** Shared systems, curious colleagues, overly-inquisitive friends, or just for the lulz!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CosmicJesterX/fragle.git
cd fragle

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Add a friend to whitelist
./whitelist_manager.sh add alice

# Test the system (prepare to laugh)
./greed_amplifier.sh
```

---

## 📚 The Complete Arsenal (18 Scripts!)

### 🛡️ **Protection & Detection**

#### `smart_snooper_detector.sh` ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- Checks whitelist before triggering
- Welcomes friends, trolls strangers
- Logs everything
- **Usage:** `./smart_snooper_detector.sh`

#### `snooper_detector.sh`
- Basic version without whitelist
- Fake self-destruct countdown
- Shame-based deterrent

#### `all_seeing_eye.sh`
- Logs current user, git status, recent files
- Command history tracking
- Philosophical observations about being watched

---

### 💸 **Greed Traps** (Progressive Punishment)

#### `greed_amplifier.sh` ⭐ **ULTIMATE TROLL**
**How it works:**
- Tracks "strikes" across sessions
- Each visit offers bigger "rewards"
- Rewards get more ridiculous each time

**Escalation:**
```
Strike 1: Virtual high-five ✋
Strike 2: TWO high-fives ✋✋
Strike 3: ASCII cookie 🍪
Strike 4: Fake password reveal
Strike 5: Personal letter from Captain Rattlecode
Strike 8+: "More Persistent Than Malware" badge
Strike 10+: Intervention time
```

**If they say "Y" to continue:** IT LOOPS AND RESTARTS! 😈

**Time waste:** 2+ minutes per strike, cumulative

---

#### `endless_treasure_hunt.sh` ⭐ **INFINITE TRAP**
**The bait:** "Ancient treasure hidden in repository!"

**The reality:**
- Clue 1 → leads to Clue 2
- Clue 2 → leads to Clue 3
- ...
- Clue ∞ → leads to more clues

**Special milestones:**
- Clue 7: "Lucky number!" (nothing)
- Clue 10: Schrödinger's Treasure
- Clue 15+: Tells them there's no treasure... but they can continue!

**Time waste:** 1.5 minutes per clue, potentially infinite

---

### ⏳ **Sneaky Escalation** (Boil the Frog!)

#### `sneaky_escalator.sh` ⭐ **SUBTLE GENIUS**
**The secret:** Starts completely normal, escalates slowly

**Progression:**
```
Visit 1:  "📂 Repository contents loaded successfully."
Visit 2:  "ℹ️ Tip: Use 'ls -la' to see hidden files."
Visit 3:  "⚠️ Note: Some activity has been logged."
Visit 5:  "👀 Someone's curious today!"
Visit 7:  "🍪 Want a cookie? You've been here 7 times."
Visit 9:  "🚨 REPOSITORY ACTIVITY ALERT"
Visit 10: Full intervention letter
Visit 15: "🎊 SPECIAL MILESTONE: 15 SNOOPS!"
Visit 20: "🥇 Achievement: 'Cannot Stop Snooping'"
Visit 25+: "📞 We're calling your family."
```

**Bonus:** Adds increasing delays after visit 5!

**Time waste:** Starts instant, grows to 10+ second delays

---

#### `patience_tester.sh`
**The punishment:** Makes them wait longer each visit

**Progression:**
```
Visit 1: 1 second  - "🚀 Fast loading!"
Visit 3: 5 seconds - "🐌 Slightly slower..."
Visit 5: 10 seconds - "⏰ This is taking longer..."
Visit 6-7: 15+ seconds - "🐢 ULTRA SLOW MODE"
Visit 8+: 30+ seconds - "☕ Making coffee for the server..."
```

**Why it's evil:** They won't know why it's getting slower!

---

### 🎪 **Maximum Time Wasters**

#### `infinite_rabbit_hole.sh`
**Time waste:** 2-5 minutes

Fake security system with:
- Loading bars
- 7 diagnostic phases  
- Math quiz
- Multiple choice that loops if wrong

**If they timeout or pick wrong:** RESTARTS FROM BEGINNING! 🔄

---

#### `never_ending_story.sh`
**Time waste:** 3-10 minutes

8 "classified" documents:
- Nuclear codes
- Alien contact proof  
- Time machine blueprints
- Illuminati member list
- Bigfoot location

Each requires:
- Password guessing (3 attempts)
- "Decryption" delays
- Disappointing reveal

**Hook:** "Try another file! The REAL secret is in there!"

---

#### `generate_decoys.sh`
**Time waste:** 5-20 minutes (if they explore)

Creates `.secrets_do_not_look/` with:
- `PASSWORDS.txt` - Fake passwords (hunter2!)
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` - World domination via cookies
- `treasure_map.txt` - Bitcoin treasure (fake)
- `secret_code.py` - "Hacking" script (does nothing)

**Evil twist:** Each file is entertaining enough to read!

---

### 🎓 **Educational & Fun**

#### `silly_learning_adventure.sh`
Teaches bash concepts through:
- Variables (Magic boxes!)
- Loops (counting cookies)
- Conditionals (robot decisions)
- Arrays (Fragle crew)
- Functions (programming jokes)
- Interactive quiz with badges!

---

### 🗂️ **Management Tools**

#### `whitelist_manager.sh` ⭐ **ESSENTIAL**
```bash
./whitelist_manager.sh add alice      # Add friend
./whitelist_manager.sh remove bob     # Remove someone  
./whitelist_manager.sh list           # Show all
./whitelist_manager.sh check charlie  # Check status
```

#### `.whitelist`
Simple text file with allowed usernames:
```
pinky
alice
bob
# One per line
```

---

## 🎯 Deployment Strategies

### Level 1: Basic Welcome Mat
```bash
# Just be nice to everyone
./silly_learning_adventure.sh
```

### Level 2: Friends vs Strangers  
```bash
# Add friends first
./whitelist_manager.sh add alice
./whitelist_manager.sh add bob

# Use smart detector
./smart_snooper_detector.sh
```

### Level 3: Greed Punishment
```bash
# Set the bait
./generate_decoys.sh

# Add link in README or create symlink:
ln -s greed_amplifier.sh CLICK_FOR_SECRETS.sh
ln -s never_ending_story.sh TOP_SECRET_FILES.sh
```

### Level 4: Maximum Chaos
```bash
# Combine everything!
# In your main script:
./smart_snooper_detector.sh || exit 1
./sneaky_escalator.sh
./patience_tester.sh

# Leave hints to treasure hunt and greed traps
```

### Level 5: Auto-Integration
Add to `.bashrc` or `.git/hooks/post-checkout`:
```bash
if [ -d ~/fragle ]; then
    ~/fragle/smart_snooper_detector.sh || exit 1
    ~/fragle/sneaky_escalator.sh
fi
```

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

### Personalized Welcomes
Edit `smart_snooper_detector.sh`:

if [ "$CURRENT_USER" = "alice" ]; then
    echo "🎉 Hey Alice! The Cookie Queen returns!"
elif [ "$CURRENT_USER" = "bob" ]; then
    echo "👋 Bob! Dennis says hi!"
fi
```

### Custom Greed Rewards
Edit `greed_amplifier.sh` `TIER_REWARDS` array:
```bash
TIER_REWARDS=(
    "Your custom reward"
    "Another funny reward"
)
```

### Different Escalation Speed
Edit delays in `sneaky_escalator.sh`:
```bash
if [ $SNOOP_COUNT -gt 3 ]; then  # Was 5
    # Escalate faster!
fi
```
